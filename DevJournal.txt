The main idea behind this project is to learn Kali Linux, a Linux operating system distribution that revolves around network security and pentesting, which means to be able to tap into your own network and test it's security structure. This will be accomplished by learning how to hack into my own computer and other devices connected to the same network. How this will be accomplished will be the tricky part. My current intentions are to use Pwnpi, a pentester linux distribution for the Raspberry Pi - a micro computer that was originally created for educational use. If, along the way, I stumble upon a better program that I can use instead of Pwnpi I will switch to that and document it here. What I have accomplished so far this week is the proposal, and I have just received my pi in mail the other day so I have begun unboxing it. It looks like I will need to put some of it together, but that shouldn't be too hard. After I have it put together, I can begin to install Kali Linux and Pwnpi and then I can finally begin on this project.

Project Update: Due to recent issues with deliverables, the main project will now be to write a program using Python on a Raspberry Pi, that can get into a computer or network to test things. Over the past week, I assembled the Raspberry Pi by putting it inside its case and screwing it down with a screw driver. For some reason, it was really hard to screw it in, with the screws stopping halfway, forcing me to drill it into the case. It's in there so tight, that there is now way I'm getting it out again. In fact, after I discovered that a tiny metal vent-looking part was supposed to go in the case along with the Pi, I had to convince myself it wasn't that important. After I got the Pi inside its case, I began plugging in all its components to make sure they work. The only thing left to do now is to install Kali Linux on the micro SD card instead of the NOOBS operating system it came with. A setback that I discovered today was that none of the monitors in the Comp Sci classroom support HDMI, which is the only video i/o that the Raspberry Pi supports. It looks like I will have to bring in my own monitor each Friday in order to work on this. It will be a slight hassle, but at least it will work.

After doing some research on the Kali Linux website, I found a good distribution of Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi. I used a Micro SD to USB Adapter to connect my 8GB Micro SD card to my computer and then began the 45 minute download of the Kali Linux file. After downloading that and encountering some difficulties with extracting the .xz file, I finally got Kali Linux on my Micro SD after about an hour. The Micro SD was then slid into the Raspberry Pi and I thus began the installation process of Kali Linux ON the Rasp Pi. Fast forward to half an hour after that and now I can launch the GUI and start to do things. I am kind of familiar with the basic Linux Terminal commands because in a different computer class, we are also working with Raspberry Pis and with the Linux Terminal. I completed the basic setup by connecting to the internet via Wifi-config, installing the basic packages, and exploring the default programs. 

New Deliverables:
March 6 - The program's basic structure will be completed along with a semi-solid understanding of what I'm trying to do (meaning I know how to connect to my computer using the terminal.
April 3 - The program's GUI will be completed with an even better understanding of how it works. It will possibly be able to connect to my computer.
May 1 - The program should pretty much be done and be able to connect to my home network, my computer, and Mr. Schreiber's computer.

Will come back to because of Schreiber-deleting-related complications.

The Website right now is at its utmost basic form. It has met most of its deliverables by having pages set up with internal links to those pages on the website. It has a picture as a header on all of the pages and technically some information because the audience learns that this is the official website for The Red Scare. The only thing it doesn't have that was promised in the deliverables is the external links which were pictures that I was going to have on the bottom of each page. They were going to be mapped with the icon they represented. For example - the soundcloud icon would be mapped so that if you clicked on the icon it would redirect you to The Red Scare's soundcloud. There was going to be youtube, twitter, facebook, instagram, and myspace (as a joke). I know I am speaking in past tense as if it's not going to happen, but it still is. I just have to reorganize some stuff first before I just to work on the external links. Then I'll be back on track.
